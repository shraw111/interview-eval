**Name:**
Sarah Chen

**Current Level:**
PM

**Target Level:**
Senior PM

3

**Level Expectations (what distinguishes Target from Current level):**
Senior PMs must define strategy, not just execute on roadmap. They should influence product direction at the company level, align executive stakeholders proactively, and drive business outcomes (not just ship features). Senior PMs operate 12-18 months ahead and expand their scope beyond assigned areas. They develop other PMs and create leverage through their team.
