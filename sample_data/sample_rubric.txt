EVALUATION RUBRIC FOR SENIOR PM PROMOTION

This candidate is being evaluated for promotion from PM to Senior PM. The role of Senior PM requires operating at a higher level of strategic thinking, influence, and scope.

**CRITICAL CRITERIA (Must meet all to be promotable):**

1. **Strategic Vision & Product Sense** (CRITICAL - MUST SCORE 4+)
   The candidate must demonstrate they can identify and drive strategic opportunities beyond their immediate scope. They should show evidence of:
   - Identifying market opportunities that weren't on the roadmap
   - Building compelling business cases with clear ROI
   - Thinking 12-18 months ahead, not just quarterly
   - Influencing company direction, not just executing on it
   Look for: Concrete examples where they shaped strategy vs just executed it. Did they identify the opportunity or were they assigned it? Did they quantify the business impact?

2. **Stakeholder Management & Executive Influence** (CRITICAL - MUST SCORE 4+)
   Senior PMs must align executives and cross-functional leaders who have competing priorities. They should show:
   - Proactive alignment of C-level stakeholders
   - Data-driven influence (using metrics to drive decisions)
   - Handling conflict and disagreement productively
   - Building trust across the organization
   Look for: Evidence of aligning VPs/C-suite, not just peer PMs or engineers. Did they facilitate decisions or just communicate them?

**IMPORTANT CRITERIA:**

3. **Execution Excellence** (Weight: 20%)
   Strong track record of delivering complex, multi-quarter initiatives on time with high quality.
   - Managing projects with 10+ people and multiple dependencies
   - Handling ambiguity and adapting when plans change
   - Risk management and mitigation
   - Driving to outcomes, not just outputs
   Look for: Scale and complexity of initiatives. How did they handle setbacks? What was the business impact?

4. **Team Leadership & Development** (Weight: 15%)
   Developing other PMs and elevating team capabilities.
   - Mentoring junior PMs with specific, actionable feedback
   - Creating leverage through others (not doing everything themselves)
   - Building psychological safety and team culture
   - Delivering hard feedback when needed
   Look for: Concrete examples of developing people. Are they building future leaders?

5. **Data-Driven Decision Making** (Weight: 15%)
   Using metrics to validate assumptions and make product bets.
   - Defining clear success metrics upfront
   - Designing and running rigorous experiments
   - Segmenting data to find insights (not just top-line metrics)
   - Making decisions when data is incomplete
   Look for: Do they just track metrics or actually use them to make decisions? Can they make judgment calls when data is unclear?

6. **Communication & Influence** (Weight: 10%)
   Articulating vision and rationale clearly to different audiences.
   - Tailoring communication to audience (execs vs engineers vs customers)
   - Storytelling with data
   - Writing clear specs and strategy docs
   Look for: Clarity of thought. Can they explain complex tradeoffs simply?

**EVALUATION SCALE:**

5 = Exceptional - Well above Senior PM level, shows Staff PM capabilities
4 = Strong - Clearly meets Senior PM bar
3 = Meets expectations - Solid PM level, not quite Senior yet
2 = Below expectations - Gaps in core PM competencies
1 = Significant concerns - Not meeting current level expectations

**PROMOTION DECISION RULES:**

- STRONG RECOMMEND: Both critical criteria scored 5, and overall weighted average ≥ 4.5
- RECOMMEND: Both critical criteria scored 4+, and overall weighted average ≥ 4.0
- BORDERLINE: One critical criterion scored 3, OR overall weighted average 3.5-3.9 (needs development plan)
- DO NOT RECOMMEND: Any critical criterion scored ≤2, OR overall weighted average <3.5

**RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:**

- Taking credit for team's work (saying "I" when it was "we")
- Describing activities instead of outcomes (what they did vs what impact it had)
- Lack of strategic examples (only tactical execution)
- No evidence of influence (only describing assigned work)
- Poor judgment on tradeoffs
- Unable to articulate failures or learnings

**WHAT DISTINGUISHES SENIOR PM FROM PM:**

PMs execute on strategy. Senior PMs define strategy.
PMs align their immediate team. Senior PMs align executives.
PMs deliver projects. Senior PMs drive business outcomes.
PMs work in their scope. Senior PMs expand their scope.
PMs follow the roadmap. Senior PMs shape the roadmap.

The candidate must show clear evidence of operating at Senior PM level, not just potential to get there.
