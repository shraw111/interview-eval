I need to evaluate a PM for promotion to Senior PM.

The candidate should demonstrate strategic thinking - not just executing on roadmaps, but defining them. They should be able to think 12-18 months ahead and influence product direction.

For execution, they need to show they can deliver complex initiatives consistently. Managing projects with multiple dependencies and showing strong project management.

Stakeholder management is critical - they must be able to influence cross-functional teams, navigate conflicting priorities, and get executive buy-in.

Product sense is important - making sound product decisions, showing user empathy, balancing user needs with business goals.

Also evaluate their presentation skills - clean slides, logical flow, good storytelling.

For the actual case study work, I want to see:
- Clear problem statement with quantified impact
- Solid opportunity sizing with TAM/SAM/SOM methodology
- Research from customer, business, and technical perspectives
- Good business analysis with ROI
- Multiple alternatives considered with pros/cons
- Clear decision framework for choosing solutions
- Go-to-market thinking
- Product vision and roadmap
- Implementation planning

Strategic thinking and stakeholder influence are must-haves for the promotion.
