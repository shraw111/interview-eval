"Digital Transformation Strategy for Regional Bank"
Presented by: Taylor Kim
Date: January 2026

---

[SLIDE 2 - Executive Summary]

"Good morning. Today I'll present a comprehensive digital transformation strategy for Metro Regional Bank, a 50-year-old institution facing declining market share among younger customers."

"The presentation is structured in four parts:
1. Problem definition and current state analysis
2. Market opportunity and research findings
3. Target business model alternatives
4. Implementation roadmap"

---

[SLIDE 3 - Problem Statement]

"Metro Regional Bank faces a critical challenge: they've lost 22% market share among 25-40 year old customers over the past 3 years, while digital-native competitors like Chime and SoFi have captured this segment.

The core problem: Their current business model is built around physical branches and in-person service, which doesn't align with how younger customers want to bank.

Specifically:
- 78% of target customers prefer mobile-first banking
- Branch operating costs are $2.4M annually per location
- Digital channel adoption is only 35% vs 80% industry average
- Customer acquisition cost is 3x higher than digital competitors"

---

[SLIDE 4 - Current Business Model Analysis - Framework]

Using Porter's Value Chain framework to analyze current state:

**Primary Activities:**
- **Inbound**: Manual account opening, paper-based processes (28% of operational costs)
- **Operations**: Branch-centric service delivery, legacy core banking system
- **Outbound**: Limited digital channels, primarily phone and in-person
- **Marketing**: Traditional advertising (print, TV), minimal digital presence
- **Service**: Relationship managers in branches, limited self-service

**Support Activities:**
- Technology: Legacy systems, 15-year-old core platform
- HR: Branch-focused workforce, limited digital skills
- Infrastructure: 47 physical branches, high fixed costs

**Key Finding**: 68% of operating costs tied to physical infrastructure"

---

[SLIDE 5 - Current State Gaps]

Analysis of Current vs Required Capabilities:

**Major Gaps Identified:**
1. **Customer Experience**: 4.2 day account opening vs 10 minutes for digital banks
2. **Technology Stack**: Monolithic architecture can't support rapid feature deployment
3. **Cost Structure**: $85 cost per transaction vs $0.10 for digital transactions
4. **Product Innovation**: 18-month product development cycle vs 6 weeks for competitors
5. **Data & Personalization**: No real-time customer insights or personalized offerings

**Root Cause**: Business model optimized for physical distribution, not digital customer needs"
