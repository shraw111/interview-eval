# Notes:
# - This workflow uses the official Static Web Apps deploy action which expects a secret
#   `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` created when you connect the GitHub repo to the Static Web App.
# - If you prefer to create the Static Web App from Azure CLI and deploy with `az`, see `CI_DEPLOY.md`.
